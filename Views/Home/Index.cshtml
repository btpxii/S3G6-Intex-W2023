                Fag el-Gamous is a famous 125hectare Graeco-roman necropolis on the eastern edge of the Fayoum Depression. There are
                approximately 1000+ burials excavated at the cemetry. There is a high burial density, because of the graves are 0.3-3.0m deep.
                With the large amount of remains found, there has been a lot of data collected from these mummies. The dig site is organized in a grid system
                using coordinates North(N), East(E), South(S), and West(W). These then individual squares are divided into another square, so an example of a burial
                location is N 190/200 E 40/50 SE #9 (usually there are multiple remains found in one subsquare, so the remains are numbered).
